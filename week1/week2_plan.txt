WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: Julia Deb
Date: 05/02/2026

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 
-------------------------
Brief description: There are biologically impossible values in body mass, it is impossible to have negative mass.

Which tutorial provides the solution: TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY

Which variable(s) affected: body mass

Why this is important to fix: Biological reason

What I plan to do: Replace with NA



ISSUE 2 
--------------------------------
Brief description: There is inconsistency in the catagory names in both treatment and site.

Which tutorial provides the solution: TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS

Which variable(s) affected: treatment and site

Why this is important to fix: Analytical reason

What I plan to do: Could try use if_else() or case_when()



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- Missing data values
- Change date format

QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. Understand how lubridate works and how to change date format from YMD to DMY 

2. How to flag suspicious data more effectively 

3.
